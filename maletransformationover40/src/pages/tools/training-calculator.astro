    <h2>Why Training Volume & Recovery Matter After 40</h2>
    <p>
      As men age, particularly after 40, proper training volume and recovery become crucial factors in achieving results
      while preventing injury and overtraining. Research shows that recovery time increases with age, while the body's
      ability to handle high training volumes decreases.

      <h3>Key Benefits of Proper Training Volume</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Maximizes muscle growth and strength gains</li>
        <li>Prevents overtraining and injury</li>
        <li>Optimizes hormonal response</li>
        <li>Ensures consistent progress</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Understanding the Metrics</h3>
      
      <h4>Training Volume</h4>
      <p>
        Training volume refers to the total amount of work performed, typically measured in sets per muscle group per week.
        For men over 40, finding the right balance is crucial:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Too little:</strong> Insufficient stimulus for growth</li>
        <li><strong>Too much:</strong> Increased risk of injury and poor recovery</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Recovery Time</h4>
      <p>
        Recovery needs increase with age due to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Decreased hormone production</li>
        <li>Slower tissue repair</li>
        <li>Reduced cellular regeneration</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>How to Apply These Results</h2>
    
    <h3>Weekly Training Split Example</h3>
    <div class="bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
      <p class="font-semibold">Based on 48-hour recovery period:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Monday: Upper Body Push</li>
        <li>Tuesday: Lower Body</li>
        <li>Wednesday: Rest</li>
        <li>Thursday: Upper Body Pull</li>
        <li>Friday: Lower Body</li>
        <li>Saturday/Sunday: Rest</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Volume Adjustment Guidelines</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Start at the lower end of the recommended range</li>
      <li>Increase volume gradually over 4-6 weeks</li>
      <li>Monitor recovery and performance</li>
      <li>Reduce volume during high-stress periods</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Recovery Optimization Tips</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Prioritize sleep quality and duration</li>
      <li>Include active recovery days (walking, stretching)</li>
      <li>Focus on proper nutrition and hydration</li>
      <li>Consider stress management techniques</li>
    </ul>

      <h3 class="text-blue-900 dark:text-blue-100">Important Note</h3>
      <p class="text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-200">
        These recommendations are starting points. Always listen to your body and adjust based on your individual response
        to training. If you experience persistent fatigue or decreased performance, consider reducing volume or increasing
        recovery time.
